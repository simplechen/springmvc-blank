# A simple Spring MVC basic application

Get started quickly and easily, all you need to have is Maven installed.

 - Clone down the repo `git clone git@bitbucket.org:stevemac/springmvc-blank.git`
 - Run up the sample application in jetty `mvn jetty:run`
 - Point your web browser to `http://localhost:8080/springmvc-blank/index`
 - Profit!!

Over time I hope to add other branches including other sample technologies.
